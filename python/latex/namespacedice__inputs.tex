\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Contains main routine that handles the input file params.\+txt for Dice. 

This program can generate a new params.\+txt input file, using user input collated by an interactive sub-\/program of guided prompts. Alternatively, it can check the correctness of a user assembled params.\+txt file, informing the user of any errors. For restart runs, this program will also check that the required restart files are present, and notify the user if they are missing.
