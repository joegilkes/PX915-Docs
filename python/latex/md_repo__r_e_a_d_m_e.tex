\doxysection*{About}

Group A created a piece of software called {\itshape {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}}}} to run Variational Quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) simulations. It is capable of determining the ground state energy and wave functions of the following systems\+: the quantum harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, the hydrogen ion, and the hydrogen molecule. This was achieved with a high-\/performance parallel backend code, written in Fortran and a Python frontend for input generation and results visualisation. The software release date is on Friday 28/08/2021.

The documentation of {\itshape {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}}}} has been generated using \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ Doxygen}}. As a documentation generator, Doxygen extracts information from specially-\/formatted comments within the code. Documentations are available in the format of HTML files to guide both users and developers of the code.

In the documents, Group A described the software\textquotesingle{}s core structure, algorithms and installation procedures. As these documents will continue to be updated when developers add additional features to the code, users will also be able to benefit from the latest features, developments and bug-\/fixes.

For any information on specific input parameters and background theory, please click the links below to gain access to the documents.

\doxysection*{FAQ}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Q\+: Where there be any PDF version of the software documentations available?}}}

{\itshape A\+: There will not be any PDF version of the software documentations. The software documentations are extremely detailed and will be cumbersome to read linearly as PDF files. This is why Group A presented the software documentations as HTML files to help users to navigate through the contents much quicker.}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Q\+: What could I do if I spot a bug in the software?}}}

{\itshape A\+: Any user who spotted a bug in $\ast$$\ast$\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}$\ast$$\ast$, please notify the developers (anyone in the {\bfseries{contributor}} table) by raising it as an issue in the {\bfseries{Issues}} tab in the relevant branch of the $\ast$$\ast$\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}$\ast$$\ast$’s Git\+Hub repository. Key bug fixes will be documented in the software documentation in the next stable version release.}
