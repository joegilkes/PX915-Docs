\doxysection*{PX915 Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems Group Project and Peer-\/to-\/peer Project Evaluation}

\doxysubsection*{Abstract (tentative)}

Group A created a piece of software called {\itshape {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}}}} to run Variational Quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) simulations. It is capable of determining the ground state energy and wave functions of the following systems\+: the quantum harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen atom, the hydrogen ion, and the hydrogen molecule. This was achieved with a high-\/performance parallel backend code, written in Fortran and a Python frontend for input generation and results visualisation. The software release date is on Friday 28/08/2021.

The documentation of {\itshape {\bfseries{\mbox{[}Project Name\mbox{]}}}} has been generated using \href{https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html}{\texttt{ Doxygen}}. As a documentation generator, Doxygen extracts information from specially-\/formatted comments within the code. Documentations are avaiable in the format of HTML files to guide both users and developers of the code.

In the documents, Group A described the software\textquotesingle{}s core structure, algorithms and installation procedures. As these documents will continue to be updated when developers add additional features to the code, users will also be able to benifit from the latest features, developments and bug-\/fixes.

\doxysubsection*{Acknowledgement}

Group A would like to show our gratitude to \href{https://epsrc.ukri.org/}{\texttt{ Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)}} and \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/}{\texttt{ Centre for Doctoral Training in Modelling of Heterogeneous Systems (Het\+Sys)}} for sponsoring us throughout this project. The funding has relieved us from financial hardship which allowed us to solely focus on the project.

Group A would like to thank the \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/}{\texttt{ Department of Physics}}, the \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/}{\texttt{ School of Engineering}}, and the \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/research/rtp/sc/rse/}{\texttt{ Research Software Engineering (RSE)}} Group for providing thorough guidance for the entire duration of the project. Their invaluable expertise has greatly assisted and encouraged us when we were formulating our methodologies. Their insightful feedback during the project has pushed us to sharpen our thinking and lead our work to a much higher level.

Group A would like to thank our Group project supervisor, \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/staff/jrk/}{\texttt{ Dr James Kermode}}, for providing wise counsel on a regular basis which positively impacted the project\textquotesingle{}s outcome.

Group A would like to acknowledge all the useful software tips from \href{https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/hetsys/people/ab101/}{\texttt{ Het\+Sys student cohort one}}. These tips have greatly improved our efficiency which made it possible to complete the project within time.

In addition, Group A would like to thank our families and friends for their unconditional support and sympathetic ears. They have always been there for us by offering pleasant distractions to rest our mind outside of the project.
