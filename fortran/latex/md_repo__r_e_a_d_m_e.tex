\doxysubsection*{{\bfseries{About}}}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Dice}}} is a hybrid Fortran/\+Python code for running Variational Quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC) simulations. It is capable of determining the ground state energy and wave functions of the following systems\+: the quantum harmonic oscillator, the hydrogen ion and the hydrogen molecule. This was achieved with a high-\/performance parallel backend code, written in Fortran and a Python frontend for input generation and results visualisation. The software release date is on Thursday 27th May 2021.

The following links can be used to get around important websites relating to {\itshape {\bfseries{Dice}}}, including the developer documentation. The latest version of the \href{https://github.com/HetSys/PX915_2021_A/files/6551917/MANUAL.pdf}{\texttt{ User Manual}} is available in the repository, under {\itshape MANUAL.\+pdf}.

\doxysubsection*{{\bfseries{Build Instructions}}}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Dice}}} has a complex set of dependencies for both the Fortran backend and the Python frontend. These are listed in the User Manual, alongside instructions for their installation on the Warwick SCRTP system.

Compiling {\itshape {\bfseries{Dice}}} requires specifying your compiler in the Makefile, and then it\textquotesingle{}s as simple as running {\ttfamily make}. Again, full instructions are given in the User Manual.

\doxysubsection*{{\bfseries{FAQ}}}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Q\+: Is a PDF version of the developer documentation available?}}}

{\itshape A\+: There will not be any PDF version of the developer documentation. It is extremely detailed and would be cumbersome to read linearly as PDF files. This is why we are hosting the developer documentation as HTML files to help users to navigate through the contents much quicker.}

{\itshape {\bfseries{Q\+: What could I do if I spot a bug in the software?}}}

{\itshape A\+: If you find a bug in {\bfseries{Dice}}, please notify the developers (anyone in the {\bfseries{contributor}} table) by raising it as an issue in the {\bfseries{Issues}} tab in the relevant branch of the {\bfseries{Dice}} Git\+Hub repository. Key bug fixes will be documented in a changelog in the next stable version release.}
